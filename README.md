# rust-projects
This is a little list of potential Rust projects I would like to implement if I had some more time.
* [ACN library](#acn)
* [real-time beat detection library](real-time-beat-detection)

## Some Research

### ACN
* Implementation of the ACN ([ANSI E1.17](http://tsp.plasa.org/tsp/documents/published_docs.php)) network protocol for modern light control.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_for_Control_Networks
* SLP implementation neccessary (maybe Rust binding for the [OpenSLP](http://www.openslp.org/) API)

### real-time beat detection
* Real-time beat detection Rust crate.
* http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/programming/features/beatdetection/
* some [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/robharper/beat-detect) that might be intresting
